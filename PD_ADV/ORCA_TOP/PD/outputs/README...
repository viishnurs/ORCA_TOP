all the outputs work are stored in this folder those are all the log files and reports of individual flow of Physical Design :
          1. WORK - for all the library i,e.. ORCA_TOP.nlib 
          2.import_design - importing the design from the gatelevel netlist and giving the design in ICC2 
          3.floorplan - creating of die area -outer boundary 
                                    core area -innder bounday   
                                    locating the area for placement of Macros 
                                    Macro placement guidlines 
                                    I/O ports 
          4.powerplanning -
                              equal distribution of power /GND
                              Creation of straps/rails/rings
          5.Placement -  
                              placement of standard cells 
                              congestion checking 
          6.CTS(Clock Tree Synthesis) -  
                                        clock should get propogated and connected for sequential cells
                                        clock tree topology :  
                                                              H-tree
                                                              X-tree
                                                              fishbone
                                                              Mesh pattern etc... 

          7.Routing - 
                            Power routing - after floorplan
                            Clock routing - after CTS
                            signal routing - Routing
                            signal routing
                            connection of all inputs after standard cells will get completed in routing stage

          8.Signoff - 
                            Physical verification 
                                      DRC(Design rule check)
                                      LVS(layout vs Scahematic)
                                      LEC(layout equibalance check)
                                      Timing ECO's (Engineering change order)
